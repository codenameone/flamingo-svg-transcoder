This tool let you transform SVG images into pure Java2D code with no external dependencies.
The following features are supported:

 * All geometric shapes and paths
 * Text
 * Transformations
 * Colors and gradients

These SVG features are not supported:

 * Animations
 * Images
 * Filter effects
 * Masks and Clipping
 * Patterns
 * Markers

The SVG Transcoder successfully converted more than 5000 icons from various GNOME and KDE themes.
On average the generated .class file with gzip compression is about 30% bigger than the corresponding
svgz image. With pack200+gzip compression it's about 40% smaller.

The SVG transcoder is available as an Ant task or a GUI application. See the [website](http://ebourg.github.io/flamingo-svg-transcoder/)
for more details.

### Credits

The SVG Transcoder has been originaly developped by Kirill Grouchnikov as part of the Flamingo project
(see his [blog](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/kirillcool/archive/2006/10/svg_and_java_ui_3.html?force=524)
for more information). It leverages the [Apache Batik project](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/)
for parsing the SVG files.
